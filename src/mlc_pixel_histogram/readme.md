## Machine Learning Color : Pixel Class Histogram

For a given input RGB image compute a per-pixel classification histogram.

As an example, given the classifed image below :

<img src="Colorful_Bell_Peppers-512-classified.JPG" width=500px>

A horizontally stacked bar chart can be generated as the histogram.

<img src="mlc_pixel_class_histogram_01.jpg" width=500px>

The above histogram is hue sorted for the chromatic color terms and lightness sorted for achromatic color terms.
