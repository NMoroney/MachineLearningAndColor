## Machine Learning Color : PyTorch Autoencoder

Use a PyTorch autoencoder to apply dimensionality reduction to input spetra for the OSA Uniform Color Scales.

The enocder has a layers to 36 : 21 : 11 and 3. The bottleneck is therefore to three dimensions.

The full encoder and decoder network is shown below :
