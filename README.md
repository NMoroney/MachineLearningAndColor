# Machine Learning and Color

Data, source code, documents and apps related to machine learning and color.

This material complements the recent [CIC32](https://www.imaging.org/IST/IST/Conferences/CIC/CIC2024/CIC_Home.aspx) [short course #09](https://www.imaging.org/IST/Conferences/CIC/CIC2024/CIC_Home.aspx?WebsiteKey=6d978a6f-475d-46cc-bcf2-7a9e3d5f8f82&8a93a38c6b0c=3#8a93a38c6b0c).

First, why machine learn colors? 

The [MNIST handwritten digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is a widely used machine learning dataset.

But color provides a nice complement to the MNIST data in the following ways :

| colors | handwritten digits |
| --- | --- |
| A categorization problem | A classification problem |
| No fixed number of categories | Fixed number of classes |
| Includes multi-category (bluish green) | One class per digit |
| 5 to 10% adversarial data | No adversarial data |
| Includes NSFW labels | Entirely SFW labels |
| Red, green & blue as input | Image input |
| Upper accuracy of 88% | Upper accuracy of 99.8% |
| Token label | Character label |
| Many misspellings | Not applicable |
| Includes [hapaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon) | Not applicable |
| A direct visualization attribute | Not applicable |
| Categorical context | Nominal context (zip codes) |
| Compatible with 3D LUTs | Not applicable |
